# Introduction

The rules of [hamzao]{.trn} orthography in the Arabic script are quite complex. The matter is further complicated by the limitations of metal and digital font technology. We attempt to give a comprehensive set of rules for writing [hamzao]{.trn} and some recommendations for typographers and typesetters.

# Disclaimer

This article is based on findings from the author's research and may have errors. Any errors reported to the author's email will be greatly appreciated.

# Scope

We treat only the orthography of Standard Arabic. The orthography of the Qurʾān ([الرسم العثماني]{.ar}) is not discussed.

# [hamzao]{.trn} orthography

## Different ways [hamzao]{.trn} is written

[hamzao]{.trn} is written in four different ways:

1. Seated on an [Ealif]{.trn}: [أ]{.ar} or [إ]{.ar}
2. Seated on an [wAw]{.trn}: [ؤ]{.ar}
3. Seated on an [yAE]{.trn}: [ئ]{.ar}
4. Unseated: [ء]{.ar}

Here are some of notes about writing [hamzao]{.trn} in the above four methods:

+ When unseated [hamzao]{.trn} is followed by an [Ealif]{.trn}: [ءا]{.ar},  the combination of [hamzao]{.trn} and [Ealif]{.trn} is usually written as [آ]{.ar} as a convention. Examples: [آمَنَ]{.ar} [EAmana]{.trn}, [ظَمْآن]{.ar} [PamEAn]{.trn}, [شَنَآن]{.ar} [canaEAn]{.trn}. However, when the [Ealif]{.trn} is a suffix or part of a suffix, or the [hamzao]{.trn} is doubled, or there is an [Ealif]{.trn} before the [hamzao]{.trn} then we will write [ءا]{.ar}, not [آ]{.ar}. Examples: [شَيْءَانِ]{.ar} [cayEAni]{.trn}, [سَءَّال]{.ar} [saEEAl]{.trn}, [قِرَاءَات]{.ar} [qirAEAt]{.trn}. 

+ When unseated [hamzao]{.trn} comes between two letters that are joined, then it is written above the line that joins them, for example: [خَطِيءَة]{.ar} [xaTIEao]{.trn}. In this word, the [yAE]{.trn} [ي]{.ar} joins to the [tAE marbUTao]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}.

+ When [hamzao]{.trn} is seated on [Ealif]{.trn}, if it has an [kasrao]{.trn}, it is written below the [Ealif]{.trn}: [إِ]{.ar}. Otherwise, it is written above the [Ealif]{.trn}: [أَ]{.ar}, [أُ]{.ar}, [أْ]{.ar}.

+ When [hamzao]{.trn} is seated on [yAE]{.trn} [ئ]{.ar} the dots of the [yAE]{.trn} are no longer written. Here's how it will appear in different positions:

  Isolated | End | Middle | Beginnning
  :--------|:----|:-------|:----------
  [ئ]{.ar}| [ـئ]{.ar}| [ـئـ]{.ar}| [ئـ]{.ar}

  Note that [hamzao]{.trn} is seated on [yAE]{.trn} in the middle position [ـئـ]{.ar} is different from unseated [hamzao]{.trn} between two joining letters [ـءـ]{.ar}.


So how do we know when to write [hamzao]{.trn} unseated and when seated? And how do we choose between its three different seats? There are a set of rules that we need to follow in order to correctly write [hamzao]{.trn}. 

## Ordered set of rules

1. If [hamzao]{.trn} occurs in the beginning of a word:
   a. If the [hamzao]{.trn} carries a long-[A]{.trn} vowel, it is written unseated followed by an [Ealif]{.trn} and written as [آ]{.ar}, for example [آمَنَ]{.ar} [EAmana]{.trn}.
   b. If the [hamzao]{.trn} carries any other vowel, it is written seated on an [Ealif]{.trn}, and is marked with the appropriated vowel mark, for example [أَسْلَمَ]{.ar} [Easlama]{.trn}, [أُرِيدُ]{.ar} [EurIdu]{.trn}, [إِسْلَام]{.ar} [EislAm]{.trn}, [إِيمَان]{.ar} [EImAn]{.trn}, [أُوخِذَ]{.ar} [EUxipa]{.trn}. 

2. If [hamzao]{.trn} occurs in the middle of a word:
   a. If there is a long vowel or diphthong before the [hamzao]{.trn}:
        i. If the [hamzao]{.trn} is after a long-[I]{.trn} vowel or [ay]{.trn} diphthong, then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written unseated. Examples:  
           [هَيْءَة]{.ar} [hayEao]{.trn}, [خَطِيءَة]{.ar} [xaTIEao]{.trn}  
           [بَرِيءُونَ]{.ar} [barIEUna]{.trn}, [بَرِيءَانِ]{.ar} [barIEAni]{.trn}, [بَرِيءِينَ]{.ar} [barIEIna]{.trn}, [بَرِيءَيْنِ]{.ar} [barIEayni]{.trn}  
           [شَيْءُهُ]{.ar} [cayEuhu]{.trn}, [شَيْءَهُ]{.ar} [cayEahu]{.trn}, [شَيْءِهِ]{.ar} [cayEihi]{.trn}, [شَيْءَانِ]{.ar} [cayEAni]{.trn}, [شَيْءَيْنِ]{.ar} [cayEayni]{.trn}  
           [مَجِيءُهُ]{.ar} [majIEuhu]{.trn}, [مَجِيءَهُ]{.ar} [majIEahu]{.trn}, [مَجِيءِهِ]{.ar} [majIEihi]{.trn}  
       ii. If the [hamzao]{.trn} is after a long-[U]{.trn} vowel or [aw]{.trn} diphthong, then:  
           1. If the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [kasrao]{.trn} it is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Examples:
              [سُوئِهِ]{.ar} [sUEihi]{.trn}, [ضَوْئِهِ]{.ar} [DawEihi]{.trn}  
           2. Otherwise, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written unseated. Examples:
              [سُوءَهُ]{.ar} [sUEahu]{.trn}, [سُوءَانِ]{.ar} [sUEAni]{.trn},  [تَوْءَم]{.ar} [tawEam]{.trn}, [ضَوْءَهُ]{.ar} [DawEahu]{.trn},  [ضَوْءَانِ]{.ar} [DawEAni]{.trn},  [سُوءُهُ]{.ar} [sUEuhu]{.trn},  [يَسُوءُونَ]{.ar} [yasUEUna]{.trn}  
      iii. If the [hamzao]{.trn} is after a long [A]{.trn}-vowel, then:
           1. If the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [kasrao]{.trn} it is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example: [سَائِل]{.ar} [sAEil]{.trn}.  
           2. If the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [Dammao]{.trn} it is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example: [تَسَاؤُل]{.ar} [tasAEul]{.trn}.  
           3. Otherwise, when the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [fatHao]{.trn}, it is written unseated. Example: [تَسَاءَلَ]{.ar} [tasAEala]{.trn}, [قِرَاءَات]{.ar} [qirAEAt]{.trn}.
   b. If the letter before the [hamzao]{.trn} has a [sukUn]{.trn} and is not [wAw]{.trn} or [yAE]{.trn} (in which case rule 2.a would apply), then:
       i. If the [hamzao]{.trn} was originally at the end of the word, but a suffix has been attached to the word such that the [hamzao]{.trn} is now in the middle of the word, then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written unseated. Examples: [جُزْءَانِ]{.ar} [juzEAni]{.trn}, [عِبْءَانِ]{.ar} [eibEAni]{.trn}, [عِبْءَيْنِ]{.ar} [eibEayni]{.trn}, [بُطْءَهُ]{.ar} [buTEahu]{.trn}, [بُطْءُهُ]{.ar} [buTEuhu]{.trn}, [بُطْءِهِ]{.ar} [buTEihi]{.trn}. ([انِ]{.ar}, [يْنِ]{.ar}, [هُ]{.ar}, and [هِ]{.ar} are suffixes).
      ii. Otherwise, if the [hamzao]{.trn} is originally at the middle of the word, then:
          1. If the [hamzao]{.trn} has a [Dammao]{.trn} it is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example: [مَسْؤُول]{.ar} [masEUl]{.trn}.
          2. If the [hamzao]{.trn} has a [kasrao]{.trn} it is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example: [تَرْئِيس]{.ar} [tarEIs]{.trn}.  
          3. If the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [fatHao]{.trn} then:  
             a. If it is followed by a long-[A]{.trn} vowel represented by an [Ealif]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is unseated followed by the [Ealif]{.trn} and the combination is written as [آ]{.ar}. Example: [مِرْآة]{.ar} [mirEAo]{.trn}, [ظَمْآن]{.ar} [PamEAn]{.trn}.  
             b. Otherwise, if there is no [Ealif]{.trn} after the [hamzao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn}. Examples: [مَسْأَلَة]{.ar} [masEalao]{.trn}, , [الْمَرْأَة]{.ar} [almarEao]{.trn}.
   c. If the [hamzao]{.trn} has a [sukUn]{.trn}, then look at the vowel mark on the letter preceding it:
        i. If the letter preceding [hamzao]{.trn} has a [kasrao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example: [بِئْسَ]{.ar} [biEsa]{.trn}.
       ii. If the letter preceding [hamzao]{.trn} has a [Dammao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example: [سُؤْلَكَ]{.ar} [suElaka]{.trn}.
      iii. If the letter preceding [hamzao]{.trn} has a [fatHao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn}. Example: [كَأْس]{.ar} [kaEs]{.trn}.
   d. Otherwise, only if the above conditions are not satisfied, then compare the vowel marks of the [hamzao]{.trn} and the letter before it:
        i. If either vowel mark is an [kasrao]{.trn} then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written on a [yAE]{.trn}. Examples: [سُئِلَ]{.ar} [suEila]{.trn}, [يَئِسَ]{.ar} [yaEisa]{.trn}, [مُتَّكِئِينَ]{.ar} [muttakiEIna]{.trn}, [رَئِيس]{.ar} [raEIs]{.trn}.
       ii. If neither vowel mark is an [kasrao]{.trn}, and at least one of the vowel marks is a [Dammao]{.trn}, then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written on a [wAw]{.trn}. Examples: [سُؤَال]{.ar} [suEAl]{.trn}, [رُؤُوس]{.ar} [ruEUs]{.trn}, [لُؤَيّ]{.ar} [luEayy]{.trn}.
      iii. Otherwise, if both of the vowel marks are [fatHao]{.trn}s, then:  
           1. If the [hamzao]{.trn} is followed by a long-[A]{.trn} vowel represented by an [Ealif]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written unseated. Examples: [شَنَآن]{.ar} [canaEAn]{.trn}.  
           2. Otherwise the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written on an [Ealif]{.trn}. Examples: [سَأَلَ]{.ar} [saEala]{.trn}, [رَأَىٰ]{.ar} [raEA]{.trn}.

      These set of rules apply even if the [hamzao]{.trn} or the previous letter is doubled. Examples [رَأَّسَ]{.ar} [raEEasa]{.trn}, [يُرَئِّسُ]{.ar} [yuraEEisu]{.trn}, [رُئِّسَ]{.ar} [ruEEisa]{.trn}, [تَفَؤُّل]{.ar} [tafaEEul]{.trn}, [يُبَرِّئُونَ]{.ar} [yubarriEUna]{.trn}, [يُبَرَّؤُونَ]{.ar} [yubarraEUna]{.trn}, [سَءَّال]{.ar} [saEEAl]{.trn}, [لَءَّال]{.ar} [laEEAl]{.trn}.

3. If [hamzao]{.trn} is at the end of a word, disregard the vowel mark on it and consider only the letter before the [hamzao]{.trn}.
   a. If there is a long vowel ([A]{.trn}, [I]{.trn}, [U]{.trn}) or a diphthong ([aw]{.trn}, [ay]{.trn}) before it then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written unseated. Examples: [دُعَاءُ]{.ar} [dueAEu]{.trn}, [سُوءُ]{.ar} [sUEu]{.trn}, [جِيءَ]{.ar} [jIEa]{.trn}, [ضَوْءَ]{.ar} [DawEa]{.trn}, [شَيْءَ]{.ar} [cayEa]{.trn}.
   b. Otherwise, if the previous letter has a [sukUn]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} will again be unseated. Examples: [بُطْءُ]{.ar} [buTEu]{.trn}, [عِبْءُ]{.ar} [eibEu]{.trn}, [شَطْءُ]{.ar} [caTEu]{.trn}
   c. Otherwise, if the previous letter is a doubled [wAw]{.trn} with an [Dammao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} will again be unseated. Example [تَبَوُّءُ]{.ar} [tabawwuEu]{.trn}.
   d. Otherwise, if the previous letter has an:
        i. [kasrao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example [يُهَدِّئُ]{.ar} [yuhaddiEu]{.trn}, [سَيِّئُ]{.ar} [sayyiEu]{.trn}.
       ii. [Dammao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example [بَطُؤَ]{.ar} [baTuEa]{.trn}.
      iii. [fatHao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn}. Example [يَهْدَأُ]{.ar} [yahdaEu]{.trn}, [مُبْتَدَإِ]{.ar} [mubtadaEi]{.trn}.
     
## Prefixes and suffixes

+ If [hamzao]{.trn} is in the beginning of a word, adding a prefix to the word will not alter the writing of the [hamzao]{.trn}. Examples:  
  [لِ + أُسْتَاذِ = لِأُسْتَاذِ]{.ar}  
  [الْ + آخِرَة = الْآخِرَة]{.ar}

+ If [hamzao]{.trn} is at the end of a word, adding a suffix to the word can, in general, alter the writing of the [hamzao]{.trn}, except in cases that have already been mentioned above. Examples:  
  [مُبْتَدَأَ + انِ = مُبْتَدَءَانِ]{.ar}  
  [دُعَاءُ + هُ = دُعَاؤُهُ]{.ar}  
  [ضَوْءِ + هِ = ضَوْئِهِ]{.ar}  
  [بُطْءُ + هُ = بُطْءُهُ]{.ar}

+ As we mentioned earlier, when unseated [hamzao]{.trn} is followed by an [Ealif]{.trn} which is not a suffix: [ءا]{.ar},  the combination of [hamzao]{.trn} and [Ealif]{.trn} is conventionally written as [آ]{.ar}. However, if the unseated [hamzao]{.trn} is doubled or preceded by another [Ealif]{.trn} then it won't be written as [آ]{.ar}. Example: [سَءَّال]{.ar} [saEEAl]{.trn}, [قِرَاءَات]{.ar} [qirAEAt]{.trn}.

# [tanwIn]{.trn} on final [hamzao]{.trn}

[tanwIn]{.trn} on a final [hamzao]{.trn} does not affect the writing of the [hamzao]{.trn} except in the case of [tanwIn al-fatH]{.trn}. When writing [tanwIn al-fatH]{.trn} on a [hamzao]{.trn} at the end of a word:

1. If there is an [Ealif]{.trn} before a unseated [hamzao]{.trn} [اء]{.ar}, then we don't add a silent [Ealif]{.trn} when writing [tanwIn al-fatH]{.trn}. For example [دَاء]{.ar} becomes [دَاءً]{.ar} [dAEan]{.trn}, not [دَاءًا]{.ar}.

2. Otherwise, we add the silent [Ealif]{.trn} after the [hamzao]{.trn} so that the [hamzao]{.trn} is now in the middle of the word with a suffix [Ealif]{.trn} after it. We now pretend that the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [fatHao]{.trn} and that the [Ealif]{.trn} after it is a long-[A]{.trn} vowel. Then we go through the rules for writing [hamzao]{.trn} in the middle of a word (given above) to determine how [hamzao]{.trn} will be written. We then write the [an]{.trn}-mark on the [hamzao]{.trn}. For example [مُبْتَدَأ]{.ar} becomes [مُبْتَدَءًا]{.ar} [mubtadaEan]{.trn}, [مُبْتَدِئ]{.ar} becomes [مُبْتَدِئًا]{.ar} [mubtadiEan]{.trn}, [بُطْء]{.ar} becomes [بُطْءًا]{.ar} [buTEan]{.trn}, [شَيْء]{.ar} becomes [شَيْءًا]{.ar} [cayEan]{.trn}.

# Variants

There are some historical and geographical variants to the above rules. The main one is a variant of rule 2.b.ii above. In this variant, when the letter before [hamzao]{.trn} has a [sukUn]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is generally written unseated. So they write:

+ [مَسْءُول]{.ar} instead of [مَسْؤُول]{.ar}
+ [أَسْءِلَة]{.ar} instead of [أَسْئِلَة]{.ar}
+ [مَسْءَلَة]{.ar} instead of [مَسْأَلَة]{.ar}

However, this rule appears to not consistently be followed. For example, [al-marEao]{.trn} is generally always written [الْمَرْأَة]{.ar} never [الْمَرْءَة]{.ar}.

A second variant is to write [hamzao]{.trn} unseated when:

1. it has a [Dammao]{.trn} and is followed by a long-[U]{.trn} vowel. Example: [رُءُوس]{.ar} instead of [رُؤُوس]{.ar}.
1. it has a [kasrao]{.trn} and is followed by a long-[I]{.trn} vowel. Example: [رَءِيس]{.ar} instead of [رَئِيس]{.ar}.

# Typographical limitations

Due to what appears to have been a limitation of font technology in the days of typewriters, metal typrography, and early digital typography, unseated [hamzao]{.trn} between two joining letters [ـءـ]{.ar} was usually written as seated on [yAE]{.trn} instead: [ـئـ]{.ar}. Because of this limitation we are now accustommed to seeing:

+ [شَيْئًا]{.ar} instead of [شَيْءًا]{.ar}
+ [خَطِيئَة]{.ar} instead of [خَطِيءَة]{.ar}
+ [هَيْئَة]{.ar} instead of [هَيْءَة]{.ar}
+ [عِبْئَيْنِ]{.ar} instead of [عِبْءَيْنِ]{.ar}

and similar variants.

These variants have pervaded to such a degree that many modern treatises on the rules of [hamzao]{.trn} orthography present the above as the correct way of writing, and modify their rules with exceptions to allow this writing.

Fortunately, advancements in digital font technology now allow us to revert back to the original rules. However, unfortunately, only very few computer fonts today actually implement this feature.

Two fonts, of which we are aware, that do allow the preferred orthography are:

1. Dr Khaled Hosny's "Amiri": https://www.amirifont.org/
2. DecoType "Naskh": https://www.decotype.com/oneliner/

With these "[hamzao]{.trn}-safe fonts" you can always use U+0621 "Arabic Letter Hamza" to type unseated [hamzao]{.trn} no matter whether it is between joining or non-joining letters. With most other fonts U+0621 "Arabic Letter Hamza" will prevent the surrounding two letters from joining.

We recommend that Arabic typographers implement this much needed feature as has been implemented in the two fonts mentioned above.

This issue has been discussed in detail by Thomas Milo in Unicode L2/14-109: https://unicode.org/L2/L2014/14109-inline-chars.pdf.

We may also mention that there is a way of faking the correct orthography with most fonts. This is to write a combination of U+0640 "Arabic Tatweel" and U+0654 "Arabic hamza above" thus [ـٔ]{.ar} to achieve the appearance of unseated [hamzao]{.trn} between two joining letters. However, this will not work when [hamzao]{.trn} is between [lAm]{.trn} and [Ealif]{.trn} in the mandatory [lam]{.trn}-[Ealif]{.trn} ligature [لا]{.ar} (correct: [لءا]{.ar}, incorrect: [لـٔا]{.ar}). This may also affect the searching of characters in a digital document so we are hesitant to recommend this hack.
