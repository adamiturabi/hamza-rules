# Introduction

The rules of how to write hamza in the Arabic script are quite complex. The matter is further complicated by the limitations of metal and digital font technology. We attempt to give a comprehensive set of rules for writing hamza and some recommendations for typographers and typesetters.

This article is based on findings from the author's research. Any errors reported as issues at https://github.com/adamiturabi/hamza-rules will be greatly appreciated.

# Scope

We treat only the orthography of Standard Arabic. The orthography of the Qurʾān ([الرسم العثماني]{.ar}) is not discussed.

# Hamza orthography

## Different ways hamza is written

hamza is written in four different ways:

1. Seated on an [Ealif]{.trn}: [أ]{.ar} or [إ]{.ar}
2. Seated on an [wAw]{.trn}: [ؤ]{.ar}
3. Seated on an [yAE]{.trn}: [ئ]{.ar}
4. Unseated: [ء]{.ar}

Here are some of notes about writing hamza in the above four methods:

+ When unseated hamza comes between two letters that are joined, then it is written above the line that joins them, for example: [خَطِيءَة]{.ar} [xaTIEao]{.trn}. In this word, the [yAE]{.trn} [ي]{.ar} joins to the [tAE marbUTao]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}.

+ When unseated hamza is followed by an [Ealif]{.trn}: [ءا]{.ar},  the combination of hamza and [Ealif]{.trn} is usually written as [آ]{.ar} as a convention. Examples: [آمَنَ]{.ar} [EAmana]{.trn}, [ظَمْآن]{.ar} [PamEAn]{.trn}, [شَنَآن]{.ar} [canaEAn]{.trn}. However, when the [Ealif]{.trn} is a suffix or part of a suffix, or the hamza is doubled, or there is an [Ealif]{.trn} before the hamza then we will write [ءا]{.ar}, not [آ]{.ar}. Examples: [شَيْءَانِ]{.ar} [cayEAni]{.trn}, [سَءَّال]{.ar} [saEEAl]{.trn}, [قِرَاءَات]{.ar} [qirAEAt]{.trn}. 

+ When hamza is seated on [Ealif]{.trn}, if it has an [kasrao]{.trn}, it is written below the [Ealif]{.trn}: [إِ]{.ar}. Otherwise, it is written above the [Ealif]{.trn}: [أَ]{.ar}, [أُ]{.ar}, [أْ]{.ar}.

+ When hamza is seated on [yAE]{.trn} [ئ]{.ar} the dots of the [yAE]{.trn} are no longer written. Here's how it will appear in different positions:

  Isolated | End | Middle | Beginnning
  :--------|:----|:-------|:----------
  [ئ]{.ar}| [ـئ]{.ar}| [ـئـ]{.ar}| [ئـ]{.ar}

  Note that hamza is seated on [yAE]{.trn} in the middle position [ـئـ]{.ar} is different from unseated hamza between two joining letters [ـءـ]{.ar}.

So how do we know when to write hamza unseated and when seated? And how do we choose between its three different seats? There are a set of rules that we need to follow in order to correctly write hamza. Before we give the rules we will first present the underlying principle behind the rules.

## Underlying principle of determining the seat of hamza

The most general case is when hamza is in the middle of a word. 

Arabic has three short vowels, three long vowels, two diphthongs, and a [sukUn]{.trn}. Each of these has an order of precedence and a default hamza seat.

Precedence | Vowel | Default seat | Orthography
:--|:------|:--------|:------
1. | [I]{.trn}/[ay]{.trn} | unseated      | [ء]{.ar}
2. | [i]{.trn}            | [yAE]{.trn}   | [ئ]{.ar}
3. | [U]{.trn}/[aw]{.trn} | unseated      | [ء]{.ar}
4. | [u]{.trn}            | [wAw]{.trn}   | [ؤ]{.ar}
5. | [A]{.trn}            | unseated      | [ء]{.ar}
6. | [a]{.trn}            | [Ealif]{.trn} | [أ]{.ar}
7. | [sukUn]{.trn}        | unseated      | [ء]{.ar}

Consider the vowel on the consonant before the hamza and the _shortened_ vowel on the hamza itself. Determine which of the two vowels is higher in precedence in the above table. The prevailing vowel's default seat will be the seat of the hamza.

This is the basic underlying principle although there are a few exceptions. We now give a comprehensive set of rules and many examples that should exemplify this principle and the exceptions.

## Ordered set of rules

1. If hamza occurs in the beginning of a word:
   a. If the hamza carries a long-[A]{.trn} vowel, it is written unseated followed by an [Ealif]{.trn} and written as [آ]{.ar}, for example [آمَنَ]{.ar} [EAmana]{.trn}.
   b. If the hamza carries any other vowel, it is written seated on an [Ealif]{.trn}, and is marked with the appropriated vowel mark, for example [أَسْلَمَ]{.ar} [Easlama]{.trn}, [أُرِيدُ]{.ar} [EurIdu]{.trn}, [إِسْلَام]{.ar} [EislAm]{.trn}, [إِيمَان]{.ar} [EImAn]{.trn}, [أُوخِذَ]{.ar} [EUxipa]{.trn}. 

2. If hamza occurs in the middle of a word:
   a. If there is a long vowel or diphthong before the hamza:
        i. If the hamza is after a long-[I]{.trn} vowel or [ay]{.trn} diphthong, then the hamza will be written unseated. (Note: if the hamza has a [fatHao]{.trn} and is followed by an [Ealif]{.trn} the combination of the two is usually not replaced by [آ]{.ar} as is otherwise commonly done when the [Ealif]{.trn} is not part of a suffix and the hamza is not doubled.) Examples:  
           [هَيْءَة]{.ar} [hayEao]{.trn}, [خَطِيءَة]{.ar} [xaTIEao]{.trn}  
           [بَرِيءُونَ]{.ar} [barIEUna]{.trn}, [بَرِيءَانِ]{.ar} [barIEAni]{.trn}, [بَرِيءِينَ]{.ar} [barIEIna]{.trn}, [بَرِيءَيْنِ]{.ar} [barIEayni]{.trn}  
           [شَيْءُهُ]{.ar} [cayEuhu]{.trn}, [شَيْءَهُ]{.ar} [cayEahu]{.trn}, [شَيْءِهِ]{.ar} [cayEihi]{.trn}, [شَيْءَانِ]{.ar} [cayEAni]{.trn}, [شَيْءَيْنِ]{.ar} [cayEayni]{.trn}  
           [مَجِيءُهُ]{.ar} [majIEuhu]{.trn}, [مَجِيءَهُ]{.ar} [majIEahu]{.trn}, [مَجِيءِهِ]{.ar} [majIEihi]{.trn}  
           [اسْتِيءَاس]{.ar} [EistIEAs]{.trn}, [اسْتِيءَار]{.ar} [EistIEAr]{.trn}, [اسْتِيءَال]{.ar} [EistIEAl]{.trn}.
       ii. If the hamza is after a long-[U]{.trn} vowel or [aw]{.trn} diphthong, then:  
           1. If the hamza has an [kasrao]{.trn} it is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Examples:
              [سُوئِهِ]{.ar} [sUEihi]{.trn}, [ضَوْئِهِ]{.ar} [DawEihi]{.trn}  
           2. Otherwise, the hamza is written unseated. (Note: if the hamza has a [fatHao]{.trn} and is not doubled and is followed by an [Ealif]{.trn} which is not part of a suffix, then the combination of unseated hamza and [Ealif]{.trn} is written as [آ]{.ar}.) Examples:
              [سُوءَهُ]{.ar} [sUEahu]{.trn}, [سُوءَانِ]{.ar} [sUEAni]{.trn},  [تَوْءَم]{.ar} [tawEam]{.trn}, [ضَوْءَهُ]{.ar} [DawEahu]{.trn},  [ضَوْءَانِ]{.ar} [DawEAni]{.trn},  [سُوءُهُ]{.ar} [sUEuhu]{.trn},  [يَسُوءُونَ]{.ar} [yasUEUna]{.trn}, [نُوآنٌ]{.ar} [nUEAnun]{.trn}.
      iii. If the hamza is after a long [A]{.trn}-vowel, then:
           1. If the hamza has an [kasrao]{.trn} it is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example: [سَائِل]{.ar} [sAEil]{.trn}.  
           2. If the hamza has an [Dammao]{.trn} it is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example: [تَسَاؤُل]{.ar} [tasAEul]{.trn}.  
           3. Otherwise, when the hamza has an [fatHao]{.trn}, it is written unseated. Example: [تَسَاءَلَ]{.ar} [tasAEala]{.trn}, [قِرَاءَات]{.ar} [qirAEAt]{.trn}.
   b. If the letter before the hamza has a [sukUn]{.trn} and is not [wAw]{.trn} or [yAE]{.trn} (in which case rule 2.a would apply), then:
       i. If the hamza was originally at the end of the word, but a suffix has been attached to the word such that the hamza is now in the middle of the word, then the hamza will be written unseated. Examples: [جُزْءَانِ]{.ar} [juzEAni]{.trn}, [عِبْءَانِ]{.ar} [eibEAni]{.trn}, [عِبْءَيْنِ]{.ar} [eibEayni]{.trn}, [بُطْءَهُ]{.ar} [buTEahu]{.trn}, [بُطْءُهُ]{.ar} [buTEuhu]{.trn}, [بُطْءِهِ]{.ar} [buTEihi]{.trn}. ([انِ]{.ar}, [يْنِ]{.ar}, [هُ]{.ar}, and [هِ]{.ar} are suffixes).
      ii. Otherwise, if the hamza is originally at the middle of the word, then:
          1. If the hamza has a [Dammao]{.trn} it is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example: [مَسْؤُول]{.ar} [masEUl]{.trn}.
          2. If the hamza has a [kasrao]{.trn} it is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example: [تَرْئِيس]{.ar} [tarEIs]{.trn}.  
          3. If the hamza has an [fatHao]{.trn} then:  
             a. If it is followed by a long-[A]{.trn} vowel represented by an [Ealif]{.trn}, the hamza is unseated followed by the [Ealif]{.trn} and the combination is written as [آ]{.ar}. Example: [مِرْآة]{.ar} [mirEAo]{.trn}, [ظَمْآن]{.ar} [PamEAn]{.trn}.  
             b. Otherwise, if there is no [Ealif]{.trn} after the hamza, the hamza is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn}. Examples: [مَسْأَلَة]{.ar} [masEalao]{.trn}, [الْمَرْأَة]{.ar} [almarEao]{.trn}.
   c. If the hamza has a [sukUn]{.trn}, then look at the vowel mark on the letter preceding it:
        i. If the letter preceding hamza has a [kasrao]{.trn}, the hamza is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example: [بِئْسَ]{.ar} [biEsa]{.trn}.
       ii. If the letter preceding hamza has a [Dammao]{.trn}, the hamza is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example: [سُؤْلَكَ]{.ar} [suElaka]{.trn}.
      iii. If the letter preceding hamza has a [fatHao]{.trn}, the hamza is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn}. Example: [كَأْس]{.ar} [kaEs]{.trn}.
   d. Otherwise, only if the above conditions are not satisfied, then compare the vowel marks of the hamza and the letter before it:
        i. If either vowel mark is an [kasrao]{.trn} then the hamza will be written on a [yAE]{.trn}. Examples: [سُئِلَ]{.ar} [suEila]{.trn}, [يَئِسَ]{.ar} [yaEisa]{.trn}, [مُتَّكِئِينَ]{.ar} [muttakiEIna]{.trn}, [رَئِيس]{.ar} [raEIs]{.trn}.
       ii. If neither vowel mark is an [kasrao]{.trn}, and at least one of the vowel marks is a [Dammao]{.trn}, then the hamza will be written on a [wAw]{.trn}. Examples: [سُؤَال]{.ar} [suEAl]{.trn}, [رُؤُوس]{.ar} [ruEUs]{.trn}, [لُؤَيّ]{.ar} [luEayy]{.trn}.
      iii. Otherwise, if both of the vowel marks are [fatHao]{.trn}s, then:  
           1. If the hamza is followed by a long-[A]{.trn} vowel represented by an [Ealif]{.trn}, the hamza is written unseated. Examples: [شَنَآن]{.ar} [canaEAn]{.trn}.  
           2. Otherwise the hamza will be written on an [Ealif]{.trn}. Examples: [سَأَلَ]{.ar} [saEala]{.trn}, [رَأَىٰ]{.ar} [raEA]{.trn}.

      These set of rules apply even if the hamza or the previous letter is doubled. Examples [رَأَّسَ]{.ar} [raEEasa]{.trn}, [يُرَئِّسُ]{.ar} [yuraEEisu]{.trn}, [رُئِّسَ]{.ar} [ruEEisa]{.trn}, [تَفَؤُّل]{.ar} [tafaEEul]{.trn}, [يُبَرِّئُونَ]{.ar} [yubarriEUna]{.trn}, [يُبَرَّؤُونَ]{.ar} [yubarraEUna]{.trn}, [سَءَّال]{.ar} [saEEAl]{.trn}, [لَءَّال]{.ar} [laEEAl]{.trn}.

3. If hamza is at the end of a word, disregard the vowel mark on it and consider only the letter before the hamza.
   a. If there is a long vowel ([A]{.trn}, [I]{.trn}, [U]{.trn}) or a diphthong ([aw]{.trn}, [ay]{.trn}) before it then the hamza will be written unseated. Examples: [دُعَاءُ]{.ar} [dueAEu]{.trn}, [سُوءُ]{.ar} [sUEu]{.trn}, [جِيءَ]{.ar} [jIEa]{.trn}, [ضَوْءَ]{.ar} [DawEa]{.trn}, [شَيْءَ]{.ar} [cayEa]{.trn}.
   b. Otherwise, if the previous letter has a [sukUn]{.trn}, the hamza will again be unseated. Examples: [بُطْءُ]{.ar} [buTEu]{.trn}, [عِبْءُ]{.ar} [eibEu]{.trn}, [شَطْءُ]{.ar} [caTEu]{.trn}
   c. Otherwise, if the previous letter is a doubled [wAw]{.trn} with an [Dammao]{.trn}, the hamza will again be unseated. Example [تَبَوُّءُ]{.ar} [tabawwuEu]{.trn}.
   d. Otherwise, if the previous letter has an:
        i. [kasrao]{.trn}, the hamza is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example [يُهَدِّئُ]{.ar} [yuhaddiEu]{.trn}, [سَيِّئُ]{.ar} [sayyiEu]{.trn}.
       ii. [Dammao]{.trn}, the hamza is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example [بَطُؤَ]{.ar} [baTuEa]{.trn}.
      iii. [fatHao]{.trn}, the hamza is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn}. Example [يَهْدَأُ]{.ar} [yahdaEu]{.trn}, [مُبْتَدَإِ]{.ar} [mubtadaEi]{.trn}.
     
## Prefixes and suffixes

+ If hamza is in the beginning of a word, adding a prefix to the word will not alter the writing of the hamza. Examples:  
  [لِ + أُسْتَاذِ = لِأُسْتَاذِ]{.ar}  
  [الْ + آخِرَة = الْآخِرَة]{.ar}

+ If hamza is at the end of a word, adding a suffix to the word can, in general, alter the writing of the hamza, except in cases that have already been mentioned above. Examples:  
  [مُبْتَدَأَ + انِ = مُبْتَدَءَانِ]{.ar}  
  [دُعَاءُ + هُ = دُعَاؤُهُ]{.ar}  
  [ضَوْءِ + هِ = ضَوْئِهِ]{.ar}  
  [بُطْءُ + هُ = بُطْءُهُ]{.ar}

+ As we mentioned earlier, when unseated hamza is followed by an [Ealif]{.trn} which is not a suffix: [ءا]{.ar},  the combination of hamza and [Ealif]{.trn} is conventionally written as [آ]{.ar}. However, if the unseated hamza is doubled or preceded by another [Ealif]{.trn} then it won't be written as [آ]{.ar}. Example: [سَءَّال]{.ar} [saEEAl]{.trn}, [قِرَاءَات]{.ar} [qirAEAt]{.trn}.

# [tanwIn]{.trn} on final hamza

[tanwIn]{.trn} on a final hamza does not affect the writing of the hamza except in the case of [tanwIn al-fatH]{.trn}. When writing [tanwIn al-fatH]{.trn} on a hamza at the end of a word:

1. If there is an [Ealif]{.trn} before a unseated hamza [اء]{.ar}, then we don't add a silent [Ealif]{.trn} when writing [tanwIn al-fatH]{.trn}. For example [دَاء]{.ar} becomes [دَاءً]{.ar} [dAEan]{.trn}, not [دَاءًا]{.ar}.

2. Otherwise, we add the silent [Ealif]{.trn} after the hamza so that the hamza is now in the middle of the word with a suffix [Ealif]{.trn} after it. We now pretend that the hamza has an [fatHao]{.trn} and that the [Ealif]{.trn} after it is a long-[A]{.trn} vowel. Then we go through the rules for writing hamza in the middle of a word (given above) to determine how hamza will be written. We then write the [an]{.trn}-mark on the hamza. Examples:

+ [مُبْتَدَأ]{.ar} becomes [مُبْتَدَأٌ، مُبْتَدَءًا، مُبْتَدَإٍ]{.ar} 
+ [مَلْجَأ]{.ar} becomes [مَلْجَأٌ، مَلْجَءًا، مَلْجَإٍ]{.ar}
+ [جُزْء]{.ar} becomes [جُزْءٌ، جُزْءًا، جُزْءٍ]{.ar}
+ [شَيْء]{.ar} becomes [شَيْءٌ، شَيْءًا، شَيْءٍ]{.ar}

# Variants

There are some historical and regional variants to the above rules. The main one is a variant of rule 2.b.ii above. In this variant, when the letter before hamza has a [sukUn]{.trn}, the hamza is generally written unseated. So they write:

+ [مَسْءُول]{.ar} instead of [مَسْؤُول]{.ar}
+ [أَسْءِلَة]{.ar} instead of [أَسْئِلَة]{.ar}
+ [مَسْءَلَة]{.ar} instead of [مَسْأَلَة]{.ar}

However, this rule appears to be not consistently followed. For example, [al-nacEao]{.trn} is generally always written [النَّشْأَة]{.ar} never [النَّشْءَة]{.ar}.

A second variant is to write hamza unseated when:

1. it has a [Dammao]{.trn} and is followed by a long-[U]{.trn} vowel. Example: [رُءُوس]{.ar} instead of [رُؤُوس]{.ar}.
1. it has a [kasrao]{.trn} and is followed by a long-[I]{.trn} vowel. Example: [رَءِيس]{.ar} instead of [رَئِيس]{.ar}.

# Typographical limitations

Due to what appears to have been a limitation of typesetting technology in the days of typewriters, metal typography, and early digital typography, unseated hamza between two joining letters [ـءـ]{.ar} was usually written as seated on [yAE]{.trn} instead: [ـئـ]{.ar}. Because of this limitation we are now accustomed to seeing:

+ [شَيْئًا]{.ar} instead of [شَيْءًا]{.ar}
+ [خَطِيئَة]{.ar} instead of [خَطِيءَة]{.ar}
+ [هَيْئَة]{.ar} instead of [هَيْءَة]{.ar}
+ [عِبْئَيْنِ]{.ar} instead of [عِبْءَيْنِ]{.ar}

and similar variants.

These variants have pervaded to such a degree that many modern explanations on the rules of hamza orthography present the above as the correct way of writing, and modify their rules with exceptions to allow this writing.

Fortunately, advancements in digital font technology now allow us to revert back to the original rules. However, unfortunately, only very few computer fonts today actually implement this feature.

Two fonts, of which we are aware, that do allow the preferred orthography are:

1. Dr Khaled Hosny's "Amiri": https://www.amirifont.org/
2. DecoType "Naskh": https://www.decotype.com/oneliner/

With these "hamza-safe fonts" you can always use U+0621 "Arabic Letter Hamza" to type unseated hamza no matter whether it is between joining or non-joining letters. With most other fonts U+0621 "Arabic Letter Hamza" will prevent the surrounding two letters from joining.

This issue has been discussed in detail by Thomas Milo in Unicode L2/14-109: https://unicode.org/L2/L2014/14109-inline-chars.pdf.

However, the problem remains that this is a font-specific hack. It seems that the Unicode has no official guidance in this regard.

Another solution, that works with most other fonts, is to fake the correct orthography using a combination of U+0640 "Arabic Tatweel" and U+0654 "Arabic hamza above" thus [ـٔ]{.ar} to achieve the appearance of unseated hamza between two joining letters. However, this will not work when hamza is between [lAm]{.trn} and [Ealif]{.trn} in the mandatory [lam]{.trn}-[Ealif]{.trn} ligature [لا]{.ar} (correct: [لءا]{.ar}, incorrect: [لـٔا]{.ar}). Such words are rare in Standard Arabic but do exist, e.g. [لَءَّال]{.ar} [laEEAl]{.trn} meaning "pearl-seller", and [مِلْءًا]{.ar}. Perhaps the official solution ought to be that fonts absorb the tatweel and not let it affect the [lAm]{.trn}-[Ealif]{.trn} ligature when it it is input between [lAm]{.trn} and [Ealif]{.trn}.

Beware that using tatweel in this manner may also affect the searching of characters in a digital document.
